# Interpreters

I am now following CRAFTING INTERPRETERS book, but in Rust. Currently, I am doing **A TREE-WALK INTERPRETER**.

Objective
- Learn a compiler concept
- Learn how to actually implement compiler, umm I mean interpreter here.
- Learn Rust the hard way!

The way I learn from this book is that for each chapter
- I use LLM to write a code structure ask it to leave each function implementation to be my work.
- I implement a functionality for these functions by myself.

How to run:
1. `cargo run -- test.lox`

Progress
- [x] Scanning
- [x] AST Support
- [ ] Parsing
