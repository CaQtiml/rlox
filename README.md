# Interpreters

I am now following CRAFTING INTERPRETERS book, but in Rust. Currently, I am doing **A TREE-WALK INTERPRETER**.

Objective
- Learn a compiler concept
- Learn how to actually implement compiler, umm I mean interpreter here.
- Learn Rust the hard way!

LLM is extensively used here, but I also try to make sure that I understand everything written here.

How to run:
1. `cargo run -- test.lox`
